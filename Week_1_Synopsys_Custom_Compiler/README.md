* #### The Synopsys Custom Compiler design environment is a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design.
* #### Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. It delivers industry-leading productivity, performance, and ease-of-use while remaining easy to adopt for users of legacy tools.
* #### The Custom Compiler design environment includes features for mixed-signal design entry, design debug, simulation management, analysis, and reporting.
* #### For layout, Custom Compiler provides fast and user-friendly polygon editing features and boosts productivity with its pioneering visually-assisted automation flow. Visually assisted automation is an innovative approach that delivers 2-10X better layout productivityâ€”especially for difficult FinFET-based designs.
* #### Custom Compiler includes built-in verification features to catch physical and electrical errors during layout. These include design rule checking, electromigration checking, and resistance and capacitance extraction.
* #### The Custom Compiler design environment makes it easy to communicate design intent and achieve analog design closure, with support for templates and early parasitic simulation.

<summary>Analog Design </summary>
<br>

  `Analog design` in the context of integrated circuit (IC) design is a discipline that focuses on the creation of circuits that operate in and are optimized for continuous time-domain behavior.

#### Objectives of analog design include: 

* `Signal fidelity`
* `Amplification`
* `Filtering`

<summary>Importance of Analog Design </summary>
<br>

* All the basic devices in an IC respond to continuous time stimulus, analog design forms the foundation for all IC design.
* Modern IC technology presents many design challenges. There is significant variability in the manufacturing process for advanced technology nodes. The actual operation of the high number of devices on advanced ICs also causes variability. This variability manifests as changes in operating voltage, operating temperature, and  in performance. Densely packed devices can also interact with each other and with the silicon substrate, package, and board to cause signal distortions. All of these effects can occur between devices and within a single IC  as well.
* Analog design must compensate for all of these effects to ensure three basic qualities: fidelity/precision, consistency, and performance. Reliability analysis and signal integrity analysis are some of the activities that are used to model and mitigate these effects.
