## Custom Compiler Overview

* #### The Synopsys Custom Compiler design environment is a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design.
* #### Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. It delivers industry-leading productivity, performance, and ease-of-use while remaining easy to adopt for users of legacy tools.
* #### The Custom Compiler design environment includes features for mixed-signal design entry, design debug, simulation management, analysis, and reporting.
* #### For layout, Custom Compiler provides fast and user-friendly polygon editing features and boosts productivity with its pioneering visually-assisted automation flow. Visually assisted automation is an innovative approach that delivers 2-10X better layout productivityâ€”especially for difficult FinFET-based designs.
* #### Custom Compiler includes built-in verification features to catch physical and electrical errors during layout. These include design rule checking, electromigration checking, and resistance and capacitance extraction.
* #### The Custom Compiler design environment makes it easy to communicate design intent and achieve analog design closure, with support for templates and early parasitic simulation.
