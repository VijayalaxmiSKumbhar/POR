# A Power-On Reset (PoR) circuit is an essential part of electronic devices, ensuring they start in a known, stable state by generating a reset signal when power is first applied, or when a voltage dip is detected. 

## Function of PoR

#### `Initialization:`
The primary function of a PoR circuit is to initialize the device's internal logic and registers to a predetermined state after power is applied. 
#### `Stability:`
It ensures that the device's power supply stabilizes at the correct levels and that the internal clocks are stable before the device starts operating. 
#### `Reset Signal:`
The PoR circuit generates a reset signal (often a low signal) to the device's core logic, which forces the device into a reset state. 
#### `Brown-out Reset:`
Some PoR circuits also include brown-out reset (BOR) functionality, which detects low supply voltages and triggers a reset if the voltage dips below a certain threshold.
